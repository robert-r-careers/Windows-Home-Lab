Build disposable Windows VMs for your home lab

Tired of building Windows VMs from scratch?
This project provides a repeatable pipeline for creating sysprepped base images and child VMs on a Linux host (Ubuntu + KVM). Ideal for testing Active Directory, SCCM/MECM, Group Policies, registry edits, print servers, and file shares in a safe, disposable lab environment.

‚ö° Quick Start
# 1. Install host prerequisites (Ubuntu 24.04.1 / GNU/Linux)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system virt-manager

# 2. Add your user to required groups
sudo usermod -aG kvm,libvirt $USER
newgrp libvirt

# 3. Download Windows + VirtIO ISOs
bash ./Get-Win_ISO.sh (uncomment respective ISO URL's before running)

# 4. Build a Windows 11 base image
bash ./qemu-kvm_win_11_base.sh

# 5. Build a disposable child VM from the base
bash ./c_win11_client.sh

üëâ You now have a clean Windows 11 VM running on KVM, ready to break, test, and reset as often as you want.

‚öôÔ∏è Build Runbooks
Windows 11 Base

Script: qemu-kvm_win_11_base.sh

Ensure host prerequisites are installed; add user to libvirt + kvm groups.

Download Windows 11 ISO + VirtIO ISO (Get-Win_ISO.sh).

Run:

bash ./qemu-kvm_win_11_base.sh


During Windows setup, load VirtIO storage + network drivers from the VirtIO ISO.

Install guest tools, apply updates.

Run sysprep:

Sysprep.exe /generalize /oobe /shutdown /mode:vm

Windows Server Base

Script: qemu-kvm_win_srv_base.sh

Steps mirror Windows 11, with server-specific VirtIO paths.

Ensure host prerequisites are installed; user in libvirt + kvm.

Download Windows Server ISO + VirtIO ISO (Get-Win_ISO.sh).

Run:

bash ./qemu-kvm_win_srv_base.sh


Load VirtIO drivers.

Install guest tools.

Run sysprep + shutdown.

Child VMs

Scripts:

Windows 11 Client ‚Üí c_win11_client.sh

Windows Server ‚Üí c_win_server.sh

These scripts clone from the locked base image to rapidly spin up new lab VMs.

üìå Notes

Base images are sysprepped and locked read-only to ensure clean children.

Built for Linux host environments today; Windows host support in progress.

Ideal for home labs, testing, and continuous learning.

üöÄ Roadmap

Windows host environment support.

Automated post-install configuration (updates, GPO templates, AD roles).

CI/CD integration for automated lab refresh.
